The 2013 [PGA][pga] season is basically over.  All four majors have been completed.  We've had 3 first time winners.  Phil Mickelson has blessed us with another fantastic victory at Muirfield for his first [Open][open] title.  The Sunday afternoon on the last day of the [PGA Championship][pgac] has to be one of the most depressing days for any golf fan.  It not only signfies the end of the season, but the harsh reality that another major will not be contended for approximately 8 months.  There will be a lot of golf between the end of the PGA championship and the beginning of [The Masters][masters], but very few events are of little importance.  Hence, the reason for the deep depression and the realization that until a winter has come and gone, there will be no riveting golf.
